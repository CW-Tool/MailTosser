This project was originally created by Viggo Lund√©n(viggo.lunden@gmail.com). 

He sent me the source files and I updated the UI to make it more confortable to use.
It can be improved, specially in the part to allow user to save the settings when they
are changed under the Settings form, currently, they only work if you change it
directly on the App.config.

Feel free to get it and improve the quality if you wish.
